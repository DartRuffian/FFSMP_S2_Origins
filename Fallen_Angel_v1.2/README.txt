THE FALLEN ANGEL:
Hello! This is my submission for the 2021 "Keep the Peace" Origins competition.

First of all, the Fallen Angel is built more around Singleplayer, and so there is no way to get someone else into Elysium.
Second, there is some things not fully described in the Origin.
	- You will get three "permanent buffs" if you reach full Morality
	 *Triple jump instead of double Jump
	 *Four extra hearts
	 *Slow falling
	-You lose Morality whenever you hit something too, not just kill, however it is less loss.

Finally, the story is shallow, (I know I didn't even have to make a story, but hey), and I would have expanded more on it if I had time.
If you DO for some reason want to know more, then DM me. :)


Have fun, and I hope you enjoy!
